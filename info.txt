Planning and Logic Will Go Here.

Scope:
1st: Build HTML
2nd: Build CSS
3rd: BUild JS
4th: Verify with AI
5th: Deploy on Github

1st Step: Build HTML:
We will add Four elements in the header:
- Again Button to refresh the page
- Guess My Number! for the title of the page
- ? <- to show the number once correctly guessed
- (Between 1 & 20) for the parameters of guessing
**We will have to assign specific classes for all fo these to make the JS easier**
- ? has to be a div

2nd Step: Build CSS:
- We will change the fon to Orbitron for the futuristic look
- We will find a good background
- We will make the Start guessing and the right section all in boxes
- We will just try whatever till we get it down.
